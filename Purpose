This HTML code creates a basic 
login page where users can enter
their username and password. The 
page begins with the <!DOCTYPE html>
declaration to define it as HTML5, 
followed by a head section that sets
the character encoding, makes the page 
mobile-friendly, and gives it a title.
Inside the body, there is a heading 
titled “Login Page” and a form that
contains two input fields: one for
the username (type="text") and one for the password (type="password"). Each input is paired with a label for clarity, placeholders for guidance, and the required attribute to ensure that users cannot leave the fields empty. The form also includes a submit button labeled “Login,” which allows users to submit their entered details. This code serves as the front-end structure of a login page, but it does not perform actual login validation unless connected to a backend system like PHP, Node.js, or Python.
Would you like me to also write a 
paragraph about its real-life purpose (like where it’s used in websites and apps)?
